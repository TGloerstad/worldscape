## üìä Recommendations for Building Calibration Dataset

### Option 1: Contact Authors for Existing Data

**Highest Priority Contacts:**

1. **Meier-Augenstein et al.** - Request raw cotton isotope data and sample metadata
2. **FloraTrace colleagues** - Check for unpublished datasets or ongoing studies
3. **Textile authentication labs** - Forensic labs may have reference collections

### Option 2: Collect New Reference Samples

**Design Principles:**

- **Sample Size**: Minimum 50-100 globally distributed samples (current n=10 is insufficient)
- **Geographic Coverage**: 
  - Major producers: India, China, USA, Brazil, Pakistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan
  - Include both rainfed and irrigated systems
  - Span climatic gradients (hot/cold, wet/dry)

- **Required Metadata**:
  - GPS coordinates (lat/lon)
  - Harvest year and month
  - Variety/cultivar
  - Irrigation status
  - Elevation
  - Known source precipitation Œ¥18O (if available)

- **Sample Type**: Standardize on same tissue (e.g., fiber vs. leaf vs. seed)

### Option 3: Synthetic Dataset from Theory

**Method**: Use mechanistic models to generate training data

1. Start with Roden/Barbour cellulose fractionation model
2. Input known precipitation Œ¥18O, temperature, humidity
3. Generate predicted cellulose Œ¥18O for global cotton regions
4. Validate against limited reference samples
5. Adjust mechanistic parameters based on validation

**Advantages**: 
- Process-based, extrapolates better
- Documented theoretical basis
- Can cite published fractionation factors

**Disadvantages**:
- May not capture crop-specific effects
- Requires validation with real cotton data

## üîç Additional Search Strategies

### Keywords for Literature Searches

**Cotton-Specific:**
```
"cotton" AND ("oxygen isotope" OR "Œ¥18O" OR "delta-18-O")
"cotton cellulose" AND "provenance"
"cotton authentication" AND "stable isotope"
"Gossypium" AND "oxygen isotope"
```

**General Plant Cellulose:**
```
"plant cellulose" AND "oxygen isotope" AND "precipitation"
"leaf water enrichment" AND "cellulose"
"isoscape" AND "crop" AND "assignment"
```

**Forensic/Authentication:**
```
"textile authentication" AND "isotope"
"fiber provenance" AND "stable isotope"
"agricultural product" AND "geographic origin" AND "isotope"
```

### Databases to Search

1. **Web of Science** / **Scopus**: Most comprehensive for scientific literature
2. **PubMed**: Biological and analytical chemistry papers
3. **Google Scholar**: Broader coverage, includes theses
4. **IAEA Isotope Hydrology Database**: May have cotton tissue samples
5. **GNIP/GNIR**: Global precipitation and river isotope databases

## üìã Citation Template for Methods Section

```
Cotton cellulose oxygen isotope predictions were based on a mechanistic 
fractionation model (Roden et al., 2000; Barbour, 2007) calibrated using 
[N] known-origin reference samples spanning major cotton-producing regions. 
Precipitation Œ¥18O inputs were obtained from the Online Isotopes in 
Precipitation Calculator (OIPC; Bowen & Revenaugh, 2003), and climate data 
from WorldClim 2.1 (Fick & Hijmans, 2017). Geographic assignment was 
performed using Bayesian inference following Wasser et al. (2007) as 
implemented in the assignR package (Ma et al., 2020).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues with Current Dataset

### Problems Identified

1. **No source attribution** - Cannot trace data provenance
2. **Only 10 of 32 samples used** - Need to debug why 22 samples were excluded
3. **No validation data** - All samples used for training, none held out for testing
4. **Proprietary status** - Cannot share or publish without proper documentation

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Document existing data**: 
   - Who collected samples TX_001, CA_001, etc.?
   - What analytical lab measured Œ¥18O?
   - What year were analyses performed?
   - What extraction protocol was used?

2. **Debug sample exclusion**:
   ```r
   # Run diagnostic to see why n=10 instead of n=32
   source("check_calibration_usage.R")
   ```

3. **Implement cross-validation**:
   - Split data: 80% training, 20% testing
   - Report RMSE on held-out test set
   - Calculate prediction intervals

4. **Add analytical uncertainty**:
   - Include measurement precision (typically ¬±0.2-0.5‚Ä∞ for cellulose Œ¥18O)
   - Propagate uncertainty through model
