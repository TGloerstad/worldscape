# Risk Assessment & Testing Protocol Updates

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Enhanced with dual protocols and risk-based confidence

---

## üéØ **Changes Implemented**

### **1. Added "Number of Sizes" Field** ‚úÖ
**Location**: Risk Score ‚Üí Generate Testing Plan

**New Field**:
- **Question**: "How many sizes/SKUs?"
- **Purpose**: Track size variations (S, M, L, XL, etc.)
- **Input**: Number (minimum 1)
- **Saved**: In `mitigationPlan.sizes`

**Why This Matters**:
- Different sizes may come from different production batches
- Size-specific sampling ensures comprehensive lot coverage
- Enables the new Color √ó Size testing protocol

---

### **2. Risk-Based Confidence Levels** ‚úÖ (MODIFIED)
**Previous**: Fixed confidence by sampling level (Low=20%, Medium=50%, High=90%)  
**New**: **Dynamic confidence based on risk tier**

| Risk Tier | Old Confidence | New Confidence | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Low** | 20% | **1%** | Minimal verification for trusted suppliers |
| **Medium** | 50% | **2%** | Targeted verification for moderate risk |
| **High** | 90% | **4%** | Focused but practical for high-risk |
| **Critical** | 90% | **4%** | Same as high |

**Impact**:
- **Reduces sample sizes** for all risk tiers (more cost-effective)
- **Still maintains statistical validity** per AQL standards
- **Adjusts automatically** based on assessed risk level

---

### **3. Two Testing Protocols Generated** ‚úÖ (NEW)

#### **Protocol 1: AQL-Based (Statistical Sampling)**
**Unchanged in approach, updated confidence:**
- Uses ANSI/ASQ Z1.4 AQL sampling tables
- Samples per color based on lot size
- Dorfman pooling for cost savings
- **Risk-based confidence**: 5%, 10%, or 30%

**When to use**:
- Standard compliance testing
- Large lot sizes (>1000 units)
- Need statistical power calculations

#### **Protocol 2: Color √ó Size Based (NEW!)** 
**Simplified approach based on product variations:**

| Risk Level | Sampling Strategy | Sample Count |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Low** | All colors √ó 2 random sizes | colors √ó 2 |
| **Medium** | All colors √ó all sizes | colors √ó sizes |
| **High/Critical** | All colors √ó all sizes | colors √ó sizes |

**Features**:
- **No AQL calculations** (simpler to explain)
- **Matrix-based sampling** (intuitive for QC teams)
- **Risk-proportional** (scales with risk level)
- **Dorfman pooling** still applied for cost savings

**When to use**:
- Small to medium shipments (<5000 units)
- Multiple color/size combinations
- Practical QC team implementation
- Need simplified explanation to stakeholders

---

## üìä **Example Comparison**

### **Scenario**: 
- Lot: 5,000 garments
- Colors: 4
- Sizes: 5 (S, M, L, XL, XXL)
- Risk: **Medium**

### **Protocol 1 (AQL-Based)**:
```
Lot Size: 5,000 units
AQL: 2.5
Confidence: 10% (risk-based)
Samples per Color: 32 (AQL for 5000 units @ AQL 2.5, reduced 40%)
Total Samples: 32 √ó 4 colors = 128 samples
Pooling: ~65 pools ‚Üí ~70 tests expected
Cost: ~$14,000
```

### **Protocol 2 (Color √ó Size)**:
```
Risk: Medium ‚Üí Test all colors √ó all sizes
Samples: 4 colors √ó 5 sizes = 20 samples
Pooling: ~10 pools ‚Üí ~12 tests expected
Cost: ~$2,400
```

**Cost savings**: **Protocol 2 is 83% cheaper** while still covering all color/size combinations!

---

## üé® **Protocol 2 Logic Details**

### **Low Risk** (5% confidence):
```
Strategy: Test every color √ó 2 random sizes
Samples: colors √ó 2
Example: 4 colors √ó 2 sizes = 8 samples

Size Selection:
  - Randomly select 2 sizes from available (e.g., M and XL from S/M/L/XL/XXL)
  - Test all 4 colors in those 2 sizes
  - Verifies color consistency; assumes sizes are similar
```

### **Medium Risk** (10% confidence):
```
Strategy: Test every color √ó all sizes
Samples: colors √ó sizes
Example: 4 colors √ó 5 sizes = 20 samples

Coverage:
  - Complete color √ó size matrix
  - Every combination tested once
  - Comprehensive verification
```

### **High/Critical Risk** (30% confidence):
```
Strategy: Test all colors √ó all sizes
Samples: colors √ó sizes (same as medium, but higher confidence threshold)
Example: 4 colors √ó 5 sizes = 20 samples

Note: Same sample count as medium, but:
  - Different pass/fail criteria (stricter)
  - May require additional verification if borderline
  - Focus on comprehensive coverage
```

## üìã **Updated User Flow**

### **Step 1: Enter Parameters**
1. Lot size (units)
2. Test location (garment vs fabric)
3. Traceability level (batch vs SKU)
4. **Number of colors** (NEW: separated from fabric rolls)
5. **Number of sizes** (NEW!)
6. Sampling rigor (Low/Medium/High)

### **Step 2: Review TWO Protocols**

**Section 1: Risk-Based Banner**
- Shows risk tier and confidence level

**Section 2: Protocol 1 (AQL-Based)**
- Sampling protocol summary (includes colors + sizes)
- Dorfman pooling strategy
- Cost estimate
- Statistical power analysis
- Testing instructions

**Section 3: Protocol 2 (Color √ó Size)** (NEW!)
- Sampling strategy (risk-based)
- Sample breakdown
- Cost estimate
- Simpler, more intuitive

**Section 4: Action Buttons**
- Modify Parameters

## üí∞ **Cost Impact Analysis**

### **Typical Scenarios:**

| Lot Size | Colors | Sizes | Risk | Protocol 1 (AQL) | Protocol 2 (C√óS) | Savings |
|----------|--------|-------|------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| 1,000 | 3 | 4 | Low | 18 samples ($3,600) | 6 samples ($1,200) | 67% |
| 5,000 | 4 | 5 | Medium | 128 samples ($14,000) | 20 samples ($2,400) | 83% |
| 10,000 | 5 | 6 | High | 315 samples ($31,500) | 30 samples ($6,000) | 81% |

**Note**: These are unpooled costs. Dorfman pooling reduces both by ~40-60%.

**Key Insight**: Protocol 2 is typically **60-85% cheaper** than Protocol 1 for small/medium shipments!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Trade-offs**

### **Protocol 1 (AQL-Based):**
**Pros**:
- Statistical rigor (power calculations)
- Industry-standard (ANSI/ASQ Z1.4)
- Defensible for audits
- Better for large lots

**Cons**:
- Higher sample counts
- More expensive
- Complex to explain

### **Protocol 2 (Color √ó Size):**
**Pros**:
- Much lower cost (60-85% savings)
- Intuitive (all combinations)
- Easy to explain to QC teams
- Practical for small lots

**Cons**:
- No power calculations
- Not industry-standard
- May be questioned in formal audits
- Better for screening than compliance

---

## üéØ **Recommended Use**

### **Use Protocol 1** when:
- Lot size >5,000 units
- Formal compliance/audit documentation needed
- Single color or few SKUs
- UFLPA enforcement action likely
- Need statistical power justification

### **Use Protocol 2** when:
- Lot size <5,000 units
- Multiple color/size combinations (>10 total)
- Internal screening/verification
- Cost constraints
- Need simple explanation to management

### **Use BOTH** when:
- Present options to stakeholders
- Let business decide cost vs rigor trade-off
- Medium-high risk (want alternatives)
- First-time supplier (compare approaches)
